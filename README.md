# Scientific Calculator Application

This Scientific Calculator is a versatile tool designed for both basic arithmetic and scientific calculations, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter in Python. It supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with scientific functions like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, and square root. This README details the steps for running the application and provides a guide on how to use its features.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Scientific functions: sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`), natural logarithm (`ln`), logarithm base 10 (`log`), and square root (`sqrt`).
- Memory functions: add to memory (`M+`), recall from memory (`MR`), and clear memory (`MC`).
- History panel to view previous calculations.
- Clear history functionality.
- User guide and about page for assistance.
- Keyboard input support for easier data entry.

## Requirements

To run the calculator, you need:

- Python 3.6 or newer installed on your computer.

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for instance, `scientific_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the command: `python scientific_calculator.py`.

## Using the Application

### Basic Operations

Enter numbers and operation symbols (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) using the graphical buttons or your keyboard, then press `=` to calculate.

### Scientific Functions

Enter the number first, then click the function button (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `ln`, `log`, `sqrt`) to apply the scientific operation.

### Memory Functions

- `M+` adds the current display value to memory.
- `MR` recalls the value stored in memory to the display.
- `MC` clears the stored memory value.

### History Panel

The history panel on the right side of the application window shows your past calculations. Use the `Clear History` button to reset this panel.

### User Guide and About

Access the `Help` menu for a detailed user guide and information about the calculator.
